GoScreeps
=========

GoScreeps is a simple tool to allow you to develop code for screeps locally and easily push to the game.

Simply edit settings_example.json, rename it to settings.json, and run it.  If the source directory doesn't exist, your current code will be downloaded.  As long as GoScreeps is running, it will automatically sync changes you've made to the server.
